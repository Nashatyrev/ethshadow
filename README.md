# `ethshadow`: Discrete-event Ethereum network simulations

`ethshadow` is a tool to easily configure and run simulated Ethereum networks. Under the hood, it uses
[Shadow](https://shadow.github.io/), a discrete-event network simulator that enables us to run simulations with actual
Ethereum clients instead of specifically written simulation code.

Check out the [guide](https://ethereum.github.io/ethshadow) to get started!
